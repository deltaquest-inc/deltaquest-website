## Introduction

This project aimed at a **complete redesign of the international logistics platform**. The initial version was developed as a PoC, but it did not achieve market fit, and with the redefinition of the business, a new platform adapted to core use cases was needed.

This article explains **how we redesigned the architecture, built the data model, adopted Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and achieved a scalable system**.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## SITUATION: Challenges and Background

The initial version of the logistics platform had architectural constraints that did not match real business needs.

- **Built as a PoC, it diverged from core use cases**
- **Changes in business strategy required adapting to different needs**
- **Existing system lacked scalability and could not support long-term operation**

Therefore, **redesigning the system from scratch was the best option**.

## TASK: Goals and Role

Main goals of this project:

- **Achieve Product-Market Fit (PMF)** (increase monthly shipments, revenue, and repeat customers)
- **Build a domain model reflecting real business needs**
- **Ensure long-term scalability and extensibility**

As **Head of Engineering**, I led the engineering team, oversaw architecture design, data modeling, and DB/API design. I also worked closely with the product team, **bridging business and technical requirements**.

## ACTION: Approach and Execution

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture and Data Model Redesign

For the new system, **we adopted Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and built a data model that faithfully reflects business realities**.

- **Analyzed logistics workflows in detail to define domain models**
- **Defined bounded contexts and organized service dependencies**
- **Optimized database design for performance and scalability**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ User Experience (UX) Improvement

The new frontend leveraged **Material UI to create an intuitive, modern UI/UX**.

- **Improved visibility and usability, enhancing user efficiency**
- **Performance optimizations achieved Lighthouse score above 80**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Phased Migration Strategy

To mitigate risk during system replacement, **the old and new systems ran in parallel**.

- **Collaborated with early adopters to ease migration**
- **Incorporated direct user feedback for rapid improvements**

## RESULT: Business Impact

As a result:

‚úÖ **After launch, key KPIs like monthly shipments, revenue, and repeat customer rate were achieved**
‚úÖ **Backend optimization increased request processing speed by 40%**
‚úÖ **The system evolved to meet industry needs and allow scalable operations**

## Conclusion

The project delivered:

- **Rebuilt architecture using DDD**
- **Data model adapted to new business requirements**
- **Enhanced UX/UI**
- **Smooth migration process with existing users**

Future work will continue to enhance features and performance to build an even more valuable logistics platform.
